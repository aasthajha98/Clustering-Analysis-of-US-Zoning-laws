Data Overview
Zoning Data: Zoning data is from the National Zoning and Land Use Database, a repository posted to GitHub by the Eviction Lab â€“ an organization promoting research, journalism, and advocacy surrounding eviction and housing. The database includes information on lot size requirement, parking requirements, height restrictions and other key elements of zoning codes for 2,600 municipalities across the US. Many of the indicator fields are also combined into index variables to summarize the data such as their own Zoning Restrictiveness Index.
Housing and Rental Data: The data on housing mortgages and rent prices has been collected from the 2022 American Community Survey 5-year estimates from the United States Census Bureau using the census.data.gov tool. This data has been aggregated at the city level and was matched to the zoning data using Census GEOID codes for each of the cities.
Population and Density Data: This data comes from the website called simplemaps.com's United States Cities Database. This is a free database online that included population and density related data for cities in the United States collected from the Census Bureau.
